IE 421 - US Flight Data Analysis
This project focuses on flight delays and causes in the  USA. We used 4 modules to show delay propogation,busy times,airport traffic.

How Did We Prepare the Data?
We first follow this procedures to ensure our data is ready.
Fixing Airport Names: We fixed the airport names for October beacuse they were shown as letters.
Cleaning: We remove the flights with no information and cancelled flights.
Narrowing: We focus on top 10 major US hubs to catch the most important trends.
Changing Time Format: We chahnged flights times clock format to 24 hour clocks. This way we could see the trends or busy times easily.
Research Questions
1-How does an initial departure delay in the morning amplify throughout an aircraft's daily 
rotation?
2-How do temporal features (time of day, day of week, and seasonality) correlate with operational 
congestion at major U.S. hubs?
3-To what extent can the variation in Arrival Delay (minutes) be explained by key operational 
variables using Linear Regression Analysis?
Our Analyzed Modules
1-Interactive Airport Dashboard
We can see monthly airport congestion for each major US hub.
2-Flight Congestion Analysis
Using heatmap we couuld analyze delay propogation through flights. When the flight numbers increase the higher
